"During this 3 day workshop we'll see the new paradigms of graphic programming using openGL through openFrameworks.
Most people with experience with Processing or openFrameworks still use old methodologies that are usually slower and lead to a more disorganized code.
Even if the openGL syntax for this new elements is kind of complicated, using openFrameworks makes it really simple to use. 
Although at ﬁrst not having some of the old functionality can seem complex, once we know  how to use modern openGL it leads to better organized, faster and even easier code. This workshop is oriented to people with some experience in Processing, openFrameworks or openGL."

*These exercises were written while I took part in the workshop as a student. Even though they may be incomplete or not fully explained I have tried to comment on all the important steps in the code. As I´m OSX user they contain only XCODE project files butt should compile in any platform.*
